Documentation
=============

The documentation is available at https://high5py.readthedocs.io.

You can also build the documentation manually with Sphinx
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org).
From the ``high5py`` directory, run ``sphinx-build docs docs/_build`` and then open
``docs/_build/index.html`` in a web browser.
